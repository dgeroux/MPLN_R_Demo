# MPLN_R_Demo
# Overview
Applying my understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. My analysis will include visualizations, statistical tests, and interpretation of the results.

# Tools 
**RStudio** - integrated development environment (IDE) used to help design and test RScripts.

**R Programming** - go-to programming languages for statistical modelling and hypothesis testing. R developers have extended R's capabilities to generate machine learning algorithms and other advanced models to ensure that R can be used in every stage of data analytics.

# Packages/Libraries
**install.packages("tidyverse")**

The tidyverse package contains libraries such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. These packages work together to help simplify the process of creating transformed data columns, grouping data using factors, reshaping our two-dimensional data structures, and visualizing our results using plots.

**install.packages("jsonlite")**

to read in JSON data structures and convert them to an R data frame
